Authors@R: person("Thomas", "Roh", email = "thomas@roh.engineering", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package provides extensions to the leaflet package to 
    customize leaflet legends without adding an outside css file to the output 
    to style legends. The legend extensions allow the user to add images to 
    legends, style the labels of the  legend items, change orientation of the 
    legend items, use different symbologies, and style axis ticks. Syntax and
    style is consistent with the leaflet package.
